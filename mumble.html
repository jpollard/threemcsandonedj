         <h2>Mumble Server Launched</h2>
         <h3>3 MCs & 1 DJ are happy to anounce our mumble server is up</h3>
       </hgroup>
       <p>One of the first steps that we've taken to create a community of like minded 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> players is to provide a Mumble server. If you're familiar with mumble you can connect to us at mumble.threemcsandonedj.com using the default port of 64738. If you're not familiar with mumble, continue reading to learn why we choose it, how to install it, and some unofficial servers for other clients.</p>
	<h3>What is Mumble</h3>
	<p> The mumble home page says, "mumble is an open source, low-latency, high quality voice chat software primarily intended for use while gameing". It continues to list some very important features such as <ul> <li>low-latency</li><li>encryption</li><li>cross server friend lists</li><li>open source</li></ul>These are all great features and we are big supports of open source software, but one feature stood out the most to us. Mumble is FREE. There are no licensing fees, and we are free to run our own servers with as many people as we want.</p>
	<h3>Why Mumble?</h3> <p>We looked into using teamspeak, but there is a licensing requirement if we want more than 32 slots or more than one server. Plus, we wanted to provide an easy to use server that supports Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android. The mobile clients of teamspeak cost money, which we viewed a hinderance. We wanted to the ability to be free to expand, free to connect to and use. Mumble fit this perfectly.</p>
	<h3>Getting and Installing Mumble</h3>
	<p>Clicking on any of the "mumbles" through out this article will taking you to the mumble homepage which has a download section. There is not an official client for Android, we recommend <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morlunk.mumbleclient.free">Plumble</a>, which provides a free version and donation version (we linked to the free version, but if you like it, consider going back and getting the donation version).
